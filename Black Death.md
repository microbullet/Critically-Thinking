*freaky ass rape name for the city of Myra as my mech*

## Appearance:
- Across the body is a sort of atmosphere, with small cloud formations a scaled distance from the surface of the body, and in general the whole suit looks suspiciously well detailed from a distance
- Above the head is a rotating blue eye that scans the environment in a 360 degree area to affect everything within 30ft of me, and give me vision behind and above me.
- The purple tiara grows and gets more jagged and brutal, extending further upwards and spiking out. The bars become thicker and more cemented as well, now appearing more like a crown than a tiara.
- As a centrepiece the battery takes up a large third in terms of width and a half in terms of height, the flowing weave is visible as a blue bubbly liquid inside the star-metal glass and the battery is protected by cast iron appearance bars that hold it in.
- In each of the places where the thrusters were previously designated as holes, now appear as genuine rocket thrusters, plated with star-metal, with steel as a base.
- The arms are long enough to extend to just below the knees, and are jagged and polygonal
- In portions of the mech where the incarnation skin stretches too thin, the veins that pump the blood around are visible and glow a little.
- Ioun Stone that looks like the moon orbits my head
- Heavenly abacus save me, its always clacking around and jittering, but whenever i cast a spell it violently stops and makes the mahoraga wheel sound 
- Weave pipes are visible going up past the neck into the helmet area.
- 6 eyes, im planning on asking kharn and magna to be apart of the mech, and if they say yes they get a set of eyes each. contributing vampyr and foresight respectively.

## Ability stuff
#### Bullshit tracker
*keep in mind that if novrkos has something that goes above the stuff below, like he gives me 70 death wards or invulnerability or something like that then his stuff will take precedent, otherwise this stuff is showing i'm actually planning to fight gael and not get pasted*
- Like 5 death wards (all my spells that can be used for death ward)
- Heavenly Iron Blood
- Chromatic roses that get burnt for special damage
- System flush, that i might use battery for, that can negate spells being used. For the new mech its being upgraded to use counterspells as well for precautions.
- General counterspell
- Silvery barbs again and again
- Using my actions to ready left arm dodge
- Using my left arm dodge
- Using a specific incarnation focus to get more dodges or intangibility
- Force some spirit to use warding bond on me to give me fat resistances and they wont take any of it because they're a spirit that is immune to anything except psychic damage
- Some form of shadow armor to stop myself from taking radiant damage
- Some altered form of armor of agathy's that uses the atmosphere to make it hurt more the harder im hit, like the air resistance starts melting his hands initially.
- Just before im hit, i channel the right leg into an inch thick incredibly dense layer of flesh that encircles me and absorbs one hit.
- Use an activation of the heart to disperse into a swarm of crows.
- Use some form of hyper accelerated telekinesis (the spell) the drag all my atoms back together like once
- Some form of anti-life shell that triggers second last or as a "yeah boss the sensors calculated you'd be paste if he touched you at all"
- Piping a tonne of weave into the black skull to bring me back immediately with a warp out  
#### Attacks
- Fucking hollow purple, if you want me to pick a specific artificer subclass it would be artillerist for gun thingies, if not and its more fluid id be picking whatever makes me best with mechs so i can get like a synced up connection to the suit. But if it is artillerist, id be making like an open air gun using the needle to rapidly hyper-slam a shit-tonne of energy into an atom and generate enough energy to turn a city to paste.

- Using a left leg dodge or just like enough heavenly thrust, dodge a gale attack, step to his direct left and use an opportunity attack as he flies past to slam his ass downwards prone and interrupt his turn.

- Maximum mana control, thruster slam Gael's chest with a fuck tonne of spell energy and the needle's accuracy to fuck up the way his star-metal cell structure is arranged to weaken him and make his metal soft to deform him when i hit him and maybe shatter his arms and stuff.

- Heavenly fabricate to sharpen my right hand into a star-metal arm-blade, thrust forward piercing into his chest and also thrust my arms to shonkle him

- Probably opening move is lurch forward as fast as i can to like mahito grab his face and slam his skull into the floor.

- During this whole fight ill probably have my thrusters up the whole time, flinging me around incredibly fast, and ill most likely act immediately and with everything i have, il be cocky enough to think i can kill him, but just reasonable that i dont get immediately smoked.
