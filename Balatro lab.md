--- Full Obsidian Phoenix ---
*Yes the name changed*

Factors:
-> Adamantium Abacus
-> Chest Emerald 
-> Adamantium Bracket 
-> Realm of the needle
-> Ichor (Fullfilled by rats)
-> 8 full hours of the Myran work horse
-> Black Corpse incarnation

Activation: 6 repeatable runes of mage hand and a hand sign from the user. Flares out 12 arms to activate all the abilities in unison. 

In a single bonus action, the bracket shoots out forming an adamantium exoskeleton, with an emerald chest bursting into place. then the needle charges outwards in a wave, filling the bracket with tubes and entirely eclipsing the body. Then, from the centre, black skin covers all the tubes. Bloodshot eyes pop from the face only to be covered with the visor. Finally in a shockwave that is visibly heard across the arena, the resulting shape violently hardens into a polygonal form, creating the extremities in the process.

Stability:
- Emerald consistently uses sew mending to preemptively reinforce areas that would otherwise micro-tear
- The skin of the black corpse once hardens holds the tubes in place. like bones.

Time:
- Battery and a small embezzling of the Ichor allows the full incarnation to last 10 full minutes, or 100 turns (1% per turn), and the ichor drain is negligible.

Excess:
- The abacus exists to both help the emerald to hold it together and compute the frames on a powerful attack. Considering this is pure raw strength without specific hax it is required to stop the weave police from railing me.

Actions: 
- Tephy want legendary legendary, where the actions at. theoretically possible with massive ichor cost.
- One punch man, Expending blood for damage
- Piercing blood, using blood as a projectile

Extra:
- I'm thinking that before the start, i start infusing the magics of a single piece as like the aspect that i take on during the incarnation, so like i take on the power of the left arm and my ac goes up because i'm blinking in and out of space. or like the right arm and my strength goes up crazy.

--- The black Soul ---

Over the course of an entire turn, leverage: 
- Fabricate spell
- Sew mending
- Artificer understanding of magic items
- Unifying force of the incarnation
Maybe: 
- Power of the diseases realm being applied over me

This is for unifying the magics of the black corpse pieces into a single artefact, which will let me use the powers of the black corpse freely

The components then become
Right arm -> The Power
Left arm -> The Space
Left leg -> The Grip
Right leg -> The Body
Heart -> The Many
Torso -> The Shield
Head -> The Life

... Of the black soul.


--- Black Tsar ---

Components:
- Fabricate spell used for construction.
- Creation spell used for material.
- Heart of the Black soul, used for barrel exit.
- Release of the needle, used for combustion intake.

Construction:
1. Creation, shooting adamantium out like wings,
2. Creation, shooting prismarine glass line with emerald as a second pair of wings.
3. Fabricate, Drawing all of it in forming a massive bracket.
4. Fabricate again, using my experience in different forms to turn my body into the main body of the tsar.
	1. Heart of the soul located at the barrel exit
	2. Left arm of the soul placed in the auxiliary intake pipes, and in the back of the Tsar's ammo slot.
5. Release of the needle to create a massive intake pipe, compressing both air and weave massively with the left arm of the soul.
	3. Right arm of the soul forming the hammer of the Tsar.
	4. Right Leg of the soul creating excess flesh to fill out the tsar
	5. Left leg of the soul used to root the tsar to the ground.
6. Fabricate a third time, lining the finished barrel of the Tsar with prismarine emerald, acting like a magical railcannon.

Usage:
1. I spend my entire turn constructing it, and charging the Tsar's intake first.
2. Tye sits at the back of the Tsar's ammo intake, uses Moonless Glasshouse, compressing and manipulating as many stars as he can, shooting as much of it into the Tsars ammo intake.
3. He pulls back the lever and releases the soul of the left leg. The Tsars intake slot closes with a bang. This un-compresses all of the air and weave, and allows the ammo to expand to its real size. The ammo then using hydraulics, violently escapes out the barrel of the Tsar.
4. Each piece of ammo is magically propelled by the prismarine lined barrel
5. The heart of the soul converts each weave enhanced star into "Phoenix Dust" which appears like a pure white bird that leaves a white trail as it exits. Each individual Phoenix dust is a separate attack that does a wild amount of damage.

Calculation:

| Thing                                         | Bonus |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Stars, 1 damage each (lowball guess)          | ?     |
| The Power (The hammer of the tsar)            | ?     |
| The Space (Intaking compressed air and weave) | ?     |
| Emerald Rail-cannon Bonus                     | ?     |
| Rot Bonus (if im lucky)                       | x4    |
*Each bonus should be pretty big ngl*.
With the Tsar surviving, because The Body, The Grip and the adamantium bracket are holding it together. 
With each attack being considered unique because of The Many. 
With the attack made easier to hit because of the abacus.
With the option to make it primordial damage because of The Power.

Then all the recoil of firing the weapon is stored using the armor as kinetic energy or "Blazing ichor" with less freedom but more power, so like all the backlash is getting absorbed to be redistributed later.

The idea is that when we molest sorrow and i ascend to heavenly sorothia maximum output that im gonna "forgive" tye, put my hands on his shoulder and return the full backlash of the Tsar into his body hitting him with the who the hell is steve jobs stare.

Or OR ORRRR, the needle is like hyper accuracy, like poliaparu but stronger, where it loses range for more accuracy, and as first act as sorothia complete i use it to split all of his atoms apart making him violently explode in a blinding streak of energy.

Also the point is going to be that its so horrendously damaging that just releasing it is going to rip my whole arm off in the process, i know i ussually pull some "yeah but make it stable please please please" but im gonna be real if sigismund doesent have to call in like 30 favours to not get completely vaporised then its too stable
