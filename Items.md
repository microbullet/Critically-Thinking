*I have this because of the Axel hand wave effect*

*Item is based on Mind Sharpener*

Lore wise i can do this because i have extremely precise arcane and mechanical control over my entire body while incarnated, i.e. i control all my blood and muscles and have root access to all my organ function except probably my brain. If i didn't i wouldn't be able to perform half the feats I've already done with ease.

- 5 Charges per incarnation

- *Original Effect*: While under the effect of a negative magical effect, expend a single charge to end the effect.

- Re-Balanced Effect: Once per magically triggered condition, you can choose to mentally expend one of the charges to contest the ability targeting you, before it affects you, or after you fail a saving throw to resist the effect. Once per turn, you can expend a charge as a bonus action to contest a magical condition you are currently under. 

  If the user would receive a condition to enter a state in which they cannot use this ability, the ability triggers repeatedly it successfully contests the effect, or the artefact runs out of charges.
