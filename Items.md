*I have this because of the Axel hand wave effect*
![[Pasted image 20241113181353.png]]
*Item is based on Mind Sharpener*

Lore wise i can do this because i have extremely precise arcane and mechanical control over my entire body while incarnated, i.e. i control all my blood and muscles and have root access to all my organ function except probably my brain. If i didn't i wouldn't be able to perform half the feats I've already done with ease.

- 5 Charges per incarnation

- *Original Effect*: While under the effect of a negative magical effect, expend a single charge to end the effect.

- Re-Balanced Effect: Once per magically triggered condition, you can choose to mentally expend one of the charges to contest the ability targeting you, before it affects you, or after you fail a saving throw to resist the effect. Once per turn, you can expend a charge as a bonus action to contest a magical condition you are currently under. 

  If the user would receive a condition to enter a state in which they cannot use this ability, the ability triggers repeatedly it successfully contests the effect, or the artefact runs out of charges.

Detective mode:
- Switching the switch on the side of the skull allows the user to see the flow of information directly, as well as the memory in an area, allowing them to place a scrying sensor in this room and effectively watch the past 10 hours of "footage" from a point in this area.
- The less a piece of information is known by others, if it is not known by the user it will grow proportionally brighter.
- Objects can be effectively read like books in this mode to find out information like users or memory etc.
